rmemre - reMarkable EMR eraser

Very small utility to remap BTN_STYLUS events to BTN_TOOL_RUBBER on the
reMarkable 2 tablet. The intended usecase is to allow the user to select
the eraser by keeping the stylus button pressed.

Full credit to https://github.com/slotThe/RemarkableLamyEraser for the
implementation this is inspired by, but it had too many features for my
liking so I've written this significantly simpler utility instead.
